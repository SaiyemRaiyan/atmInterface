 ATM Interface project

It is a ATM management system how actually ATM machine works for example how to deposit or withdraw from ATM. Also how data all updated data and history has been updated in file system. We use Java here. It's an OOP based project. I use Encapsulation, inheritance, interface and Abstract class.
